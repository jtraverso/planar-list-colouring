## SimpleGraph

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Basic.lean`, line 95:

```lean
/-- A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `Adj` on a vertex type `V`.
The relation describes which pairs of vertices are adjacent.
There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent vertices;
see `SimpleGraph.edgeSet` for the corresponding edge set.

## SimpleGraph.Dart

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Dart.lean`, line 27:

```lean
/-- A `Dart` is an oriented edge, implemented as an ordered pair of adjacent vertices.

## SimpleGraph.induce

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Maps.lean`, line 227:

## completeBipartiteGraph

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Basic.lean`, line 156:

```lean
/-- Two vertices are adjacent in the complete bipartite graph on two vertex types
if and only if they are not from the same side.
Any bipartite graph may be regarded as a subgraph of one of these. -/

  Adj v w := v.isLeft ∧ w.isRight ∨ v.isRight ∧ w.isLeft
```

## Top graph (complete graph)

```lean
@[simp]
theorem top_adj (v w : V) : (⊤ : SimpleGraph V).Adj v w ↔ v ≠ w :=
  Iff.rfl
```

## Graph homomorphisms `G →g H`

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Maps.lean`, line 293:

```lean
/-- A graph homomorphism is a map on vertex sets that respects adjacency relations.

The notation `G →g G'` represents the type of graph homomorphisms. -/
abbrev Hom :=
  RelHom G.Adj G'.Adj
```

## SimpleGraph.Coloring

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Coloring/Vertex.lean`, line 74:

```lean
/-- An `α`-coloring of a simple graph `G` is a homomorphism of `G` into the complete graph on `α`.
This is also known as a proper coloring.

  C.map_rel h
```

## SimpleGraph.Colorable

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Coloring/Vertex.lean`, line 163:

```

## SimpleGraph.Connected

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Connected.lean`, line 314:

```lean
/-- A graph is connected if it's preconnected and contains at least one vertex.
This follows the convention observed by mathlib that something is connected iff it has
exactly one connected component.

There is a `CoeFun` instance so that `h u v` can be used instead of `h.Preconnected u v`. -/

def Preconnected : Prop := ∀ u v : V, G.Reachable u v
```

## SimpleGraph.Reachable

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Connected.lean`, line 52:

```lean
/-- Two vertices are *reachable* if there is a walk between them.
This is equivalent to `Relation.ReflTransGen` of `G.Adj`.
See `SimpleGraph.reachable_iff_reflTransGen`. -/
def Reachable (u v : V) : Prop := Nonempty (G.Walk u v)
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Walk/Basic.lean`, line 54:

```lean
/-- A walk is a sequence of adjacent vertices.  For vertices `u v : V`,
the type `walk u v` consists of all walks starting at `u` and ending at `v`.

We say that a walk *visits* the vertices it contains.  The set of vertices a
walk visits is `SimpleGraph.Walk.support`.

See `SimpleGraph.Walk.nil'` and `SimpleGraph.Walk.cons'` for patterns that
can be useful in definitions since they make the vertices explicit. -/
